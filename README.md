My replication pacake for STA-145. Taking data from the top 120 cities in the U.S. by population and analyzing population, density, climate, education, unemployment, and climate. 

The data for this project was taken from the top 120 cities in the U.S. by population size, to get a solid range of cities from across the country, with different economies, climates and ways of life. Information was taken off of Wikipedia, which came from the U.S census

To operationalize population and population density, we took the information off of Wikipedia with the official counts. 
Eduation level was operatationalized by looking at the amount of adults with at least a bachelor's degree in the city. Unemployment rate was taken by looking at the percentage of unemployed adults in the city.
Landlocked was operationalized by using dummy variables, as well as climate.
